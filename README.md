# Tambur

Tambur is an open-source library for the FEC schemes in our paper published at NSDI '23 â€” [Tambur: Efficient loss recovery for videoconferencing via streaming
codes](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi23/presentation/rudow). The library is meant to enable rapid prototyping of new FEC schemes for videoconferencing. To ensure the confidentiality of the dataset the ML models used in our paper were trianed on, the models are not released as part of this library. Within the library, Tambur defaults to Tambur-full-BW until a new ML model is used for Tambur. 

### Building

```
chmod +x tambur_install.sh
bash tambur_install.sh
./autogen.sh
./configure
make -j
```

### Example 1: UDP echo server and client

```
cd src/example/
./udp_echo_server <server_port>
./udp_echo_client <server_ip> <server_port>
```

### Example 2: UDP datagram serialization

```
cd src/example/
./udp_receiver <receiver_port>
./udp_sender <receiver_ip> <receiver_port>
```


You may need to run sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 to run Mahimahi on your system (everytime it reboots)

# Example use with dummy sizes for video frames 
```
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 ;
python src/scripts/generate_traces.py --outputFolder OUTPUT_FOLDER --num_traces NUM_TRACES --length NUM_FRAMES ;
python src/scripts/bootstrap.py --num_core_pairs NUM_PAIRS_OF_CORES_AVAILABLE --trace_folder OUTPUT_FOLDER --config configs/example_bootstrap.json --hc_ge 1; 
src/plot/generate_all_plots_FEC_only.sh --config=configs/example_bootstrap.json --plot-folder=../PLOT_FOLDER ; 
```

### Scripts Description and Usage
```
# this script generates dummy traces used for fec_examples
src/scripts/generate_traces.py log_folder_name

sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
# This script is used to get GE model parameters based on a config and a trace
# It returns transition_good_bad transition_bad_good loss_good_state loss_bad_state
```
src/fec_examples/get_ge_params  <config> <trace> 
```
# This script accepts a folder containing configs and runs for all configs
# optional arguments --hc-ge to use ge parameters from the config t_gb probability transition good to bad t_bg probability of transition bad to good l_g probability of loss in good state l_b probability of loss in bad state
# --no-mahi to turn off mahimahi
```
src/scripts/run-all-configs.sh --config_folder=<path>
```

# This script accepts a config and runs experiment according to that config 
# (It goes over all traces in the trace file)
```
src/scripts/run-config.sh --config=<path>
```
# It first runs get_ge_params over the trace and gets GE model parameters for MahiMahi
# It then starts multi_receiver on the port specified in the config
# Then, it calls sender_trace which sends data packets over MahiMahi
# using Packet sizes from the trace

#this script generates plots
```
src/plot/generate_all_plots.sh --config=<path> --plot-folder=<path>
```

### Some information about logging
* log_event: This function is used to note the timestamp(microseconds since epoch) of an event along with some additional information
* log_value: This function is used to note some value along with some additional information

Note all times are in microseconds
* Some important log files
    - frame_generator/encode: Time to encode
    - frame_generator/generate_frame_parity_pkts: Time to generate frame parity packets
    - frame_generator/generate_frame_pkts: Time to generate frame data packets
    - receiver/can_decode: Time taken in can_decode
    - receiver/decode: Time taken in decode
    - receiver/qr: QR score
    - receiver/qualityReporter_->generate_quality_report: Time taken to generate QR score
    - receiver/receieve_pkt: End to end time taken by receive_pkt function
    - receiver/received_frames_log: Information about received frames
    - receiver/received_frames_loss_info: indices, packet_losses, frame_losses
    - receiver/RS_FEC: Time taken in Reed Solomon FEC (decode portion). This is a subset of decode time
    - sender/data_pkt: Sizes of data packets and their frame numbers
    - sender/handle_feedback: Time taken in handle feedback
    - sender/next_frame: time taken by next frame
    - sender/par_pkt: Sizes of parity packets and their frame numbers
    - sender/send_pkt: Timestamp when packet was sent and frame number
